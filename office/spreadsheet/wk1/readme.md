## About these files
Sample Lotus 1-2-3 files. Files most likely created in Quattro Pro, except PF.WK1 which I'm fairly sure was created in Lotus 1-2-3 (don't know which version).

Incidentally the PF.WK1 file appears to contain some 'hidden' references (in Dutch) to migration in the province of Utrecht, which you only see if you open the file in a Hex editor. Proper next-level weirdness, given that the actual (visible) contents are soil moisture measurements ...
