Original files are PowerPoint 4.

Files ending '2002.ppt' were converted to the newer binary format using PowerPoint for Mac 2001 (on OS version 10.2.8, 800 MHZ PowerPC G4). See below.

Migration of PowerPoint for Mac 4 files
---------------------------------------
 
Chris Rusbridge has a collection of .ppt files created several years ago with Office for Mac 4 and has found himself unable to open these files to assess their personal value.
 
Coincidentally, in the course of my recent research as The National Archives’ File Format Signature Developer, I looked at Office for Mac formats, and found that, while Excel and Word documents had a common format with their Windows counterparts, PowerPoint files versions 3 and 4 did not.
 
At The National Archives, we hold a sizeable software library and a 2000~ era iMac running OSX (OS version 10.2.8, 800 MHZ PowerPC G4), so, as an exercise in file format migration, I decided to attempt to make these files readable. The trade-off is that this provides me with some real samples of PowerPoint for Mac 4, from which to attempt to derive a format signature.
 
I installed PowerPoint for Mac 2001 and attempted to open the files. The application briefly displayed a message along the lines of ‘Updating from earlier version’. Once complete I then saved the files as native Office for Mac 2001 .ppt, which my research suggests is identical to the Windows .ppt 1997-2003 versions
 
I then transferred the files to my Windows XP system, running Office 2007, and found that the files were able to be opened fully.
